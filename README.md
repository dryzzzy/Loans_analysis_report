# Loans_analysis_report
The goal of this project is to analyze the actual data set of Czech banks' offerings (loans, transactions and other information) using SQL queries. The data has been anonymized.

Link to the dataset - https://relational-data.org/dataset/Financial
This is a collection of financial information from a certain Czech bank. The dataset contains data for more than 5300 customers with about one million transactions. What's more, the bank has also released data for nearly 700 loans granted and about 900 credit cards issued.

**The purpose of this project is to accomplish the following tasks**:
- summarize loans in the relevant time regimes
- distinguish between repaid and defaulted loans
- give an overall view of the number of loans granted and the total amount of money granted
- analyze loans by customer, gender and place of residence
- create a reminder procedure for credit cards approaching expiration
